# Robotic-projects

This repository is a collection of projects related implemented in Robotics domain. Any robotic system is built on four important modules viz. Environment sensing, Robot Localization, Planning and Control. Projects falling under each category are grouped below.

## Environment sensing and Sensor Fusion

  1. [Sensor Fusion using Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/sohonisaurabh/robotic-projects/tree/master/Sensor-Fusion-Extended-Kalman-Filter).
  2. [Sensor Fusion using Unscented Kalman Filter](https://github.com/sohonisaurabh/robotic-projects/tree/master/Sensor-Fusion-Unscented-Kalman-Filter).

## Robot Localization

  1. [Robot Localization using Particle Filter](https://github.com/sohonisaurabh/robotic-projects/tree/master/Localization-Particle-Filter).
  
## Control

  1. [Robotic Control using PID Controller](https://github.com/sohonisaurabh/robotic-projects/tree/master/PID-Controller-Self-Driving-Car).
  2. [Robotic Control using Model Predictive Controller](https://github.com/sohonisaurabh/robotic-projects/tree/master/Model-Predictive-Controller-Self-Driving-Car).
